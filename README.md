Stacked Deck is a third party app that is used to generate a Randomized Deck for users to use in Legends of Runeterra.

	By logging in users will be able to: 
		Update the amount of each card they have.
			Allows the app to generate a deck immediately usable.
 		Save and Load previously generated decks.

As a guest, uses will not be able to update card amounts nor will they be able to save and load decks.
    
IMPORTANT NOTE: When prompted for Username and Password, this is NOT your Legends of Runeterra login information.
    			Please use an arbitrary Username and Password for registration, one that does not contain any personal information.
